| RAM usage                  | 100-400mb~              | 400mb-1GB | 100mb      | 100mb-250mb                               |
| Does it suck               | no (debunked by snopes) | yes       | kind of?   | hit and miss with search filters          |
| Does it work               | ye                      | lmao      | shits dead | works $rightNow, it's actually kinda cool |

## Features
1. Rotating proxies on a per-scraper basis
2. Search filters, which SearxNG lacks for the most part
3. Bot protection that *actually* filters out the bots (when configured)
4. Interface doesn't require javascript
5. Favicon fetcher with caching support & image proxy
6. Bunch of other shits

tl;dr 4get is the best way to browse for shit.
